## Project Description
This project involves the development of a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting PPE in industrial environments. The "PPE_Detection Image Dataset" from Roboflow, consisting of 3,290 images resized to 640x640 pixels, was used for training the model. The key challenge addressed in this project is the balance between achieving high precision and recall in the detection process. We are currently focused on enhancing the model's accuracy and reducing the incidence of false positives.

## Key Objectives

### Package Installation
Gather and install the requisite packages and libraries necessary for building the PPE detection system.

### Data Preparation
Explore and import the dataset, identifying crucial parameters related to PPE detection. Ensure data readiness for model training.

### Data Augmentation
Inspect the training data, apply augmentation techniques to expand the dataset, and visualize the augmented data for quality assurance.

### Model Setup
Instantiate the machine learning model, define key metrics for evaluation, set model parameters, and select an optimizer for training.

### Model Training
Train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance against defined metrics. Fine-tune the model as needed for optimal results.

### Real-world Application
Acquire sample industrial videos where worker presence is clearly depicted. Deploy the trained model to make predictions and validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

This project endeavors to create a holistic PPE detection system, spanning the entire development pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment, to enhance workplace safety and regulatory compliance across diverse industrial sectors by achieving these objectives.
